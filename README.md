🧠 PoseShift.AI


PoseShift.AI is a hybrid AI framework that combines pose generation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and large language models (LLMs) to generate, interpret, and analyze human poses with technical precision. From synthesizing realistic motion data to providing descriptive feedback via natural language, PoseShift.AI is designed for research and real-world applications in motion intelligence.
